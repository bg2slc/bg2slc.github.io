          <h1>Hello</h1>
          <p>I'm Benjamin Garrett, this an introduction to my portfolio. All of these are personal projects, most of my projects are just experimental and intended for self-learning. However, there are a lot, and not all of them are worth looking at.</p>

          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <img class="photo" src="images/1024-1365.jpg" alt="Picture of me and my wife">

          <p>I first started getting into programming at 14 years old, and if I remember correctly I probably started with a turtle drawing language based on Turing. Since then I've learned to work with a variety of language such as Java, C++, C, C#, Scheme, Javascript, Lua, and Bash.</p>
          <p>Since then, I've attended Carleton University in Ottawa, and while I didn't finish my program there I learned a lot about Computer Science, programming, operating systems, abstract data structures and algorithms, and it's where I first got started in GNU/Linux.</p>
          <p>My first distro I ever touched was Fedora Core 4, after that Ubuntu 8.04, and then I challenged myself to use Slackware without dual-booting for a full year, and after that I was hooked. These days, I use Arch Linux on all of my personal systems, and only use Windows as required for work.</p>
          <p>In the years after university, I've worked a very wide variety of non-coding jobs, everything from custodial work, to solar panel installation at solar farms, to an inbound customer and retail service rep for a couple of US telecoms. During most of this time, I continued to learn about Linux and programming.</p>
          <p>In 2021 I got into the St Lawrence Computer Programming and Analysis advanced diploma program, to get a foothold in the industry. Later in the program, I applied for and was accepted for a co-op position at Novari Health, where I would later gain full-time employment after graduating.</p>
          <p>I'm currently employed as an Implementations Developer at Novari Health, a lot of the projects listed here were written before I began work there.</p>

          <p>I make pretty good use of github for sharing and creating small projects. Here is a few repos from my learning portfolio. Some of them are personal, and some of them are for previous classes.</p>
